# Collatz-Function

This python code is based on famous mathematics problem called "Collatz Conjucture".
The Code provided here is of auto mathematical function created from the statement of the conjucture.
For more you can read about the original conjucure on here https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html, and afterward can explore the given code.

The main function is the auto-function that does one time process on given input number. Iteration of main function is where you can truly work with statement of conjucture.

The given graphs are from DESMOS and are general stranded graphs.
